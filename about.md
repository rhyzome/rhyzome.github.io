## Profile / Summary

------

Background in Biology and Chemistry, studied in Sofia University (Bulgaria) and Aarhus Technical College, Denmark (as Chemical and Biotechnical Science). Occasionally taking extra-curricular courses and visiting lectures in other departments/areas where having been interested in or curious to know more about (philosophy, art history, journalism, etc.) Worked as an intern for a brief period of time in a biotechnology institute before reorienting towards working in IT.

Following several years paid work experience in the IT industry, mostly in the area/departments of *NIX systems administration: server maintenance, monitoring and support, system upgrades and security, etc. Both in large enterprise and small startup company environments. Familiarized myself with various protocol stacks and industry standards in the process of work, adapting to company environment and culture, realizing how responsibilities are allocated and carried out among departments cooperating in various ways and to different degrees.

Lived for a few year long intervals in a number of different countries over the past decade (Czech, Israel, Taiwan, etc.), having during that time also taken up other kinds of work along the way, including briefly at an investment brokerage firm in Prague, construction and drilling jobs, writing (articles, news, high-level technical overviews, guides, etc.), translations, editing and proofreading, English teaching, software-related and web design, etc. Including an year and a half long stretch of mostly volunteer work in an Israeli kibbutz.

Largely self-taught and perpetually occupied with expanding my scope of understanding and erudition. Often self-invested in researching and learning about something specific in more depth and detail, with a range of interests and varying degrees of familiarity/knowledge across different domains and disciplines. Recognizing of the necessity for cultivating a nuanced, multi-disciplinary perspective and approach to problem-solving in dynamic circumstances involving complex systems and non-linear interdependencies. Aware of the (sometimes quite significant) gaps between theory and practice, and that models mostly serve as orientation heuristics and rough approximations rather than universally applicable recipes and prescriptions.

- **Text, IDEs:** Atom, vim, Markdown, LaTeX, pandoc, etc.

- **Programming/scripting:** Python, Javascript, Lua, bash shell (regex, grep, sed/awk, dataflow pipes, etc.)

- **Security and penetration testing**, some previous experience with (not too recent, however). The standard toolbox of what now goes under Kali Linux (formerly BackTrack): Wireshark, Metasploit, Hydra, OWASP, nmap, nikto, netcat, etc. 

- **Data science with Python**, some working knowledge in (looking to possibly further expand upon).

- **Virtualization**: Docker, VirtualBox

- **Quick to learn and pick up** on new things as I come across them (especially if properly motivated)

- **Easily a team player**, granted the team is more or less on the same page in their ideas of what the purpose of our joint efforts is and what are the goals we think we are together working to pursue (as people sometimes have very strange notions as to what the nature and purpose of their work is, perhaps consistent with and/or revealing of what motivates them individually). 

- **Insisting on actually understanding** what I am doing as thoroughly as possible and feel a sense of satisfaction from succeeding at breaking things down for others in terms that make sense to them in their individual circumstances of how they could meaningfully frame them. 

- **Driven by interest, curiosity and experimentation** as well as to diversify skills, acquire knowledge and accumulate experience in applied practice. Highly appreciative and respectful of people I can learn something significant or useful from.

  

## Areas of Interest 

------

A fairly wide range of varied interests across diverse domains, disciplines and studies (as developed throughout the years). Came to develop an avid interest in distributed systems over the past ~3 years (e.g., systems economies, regimes of data coordination, approaching organizational complexity, forms of shared ledgers and applied data validation heuristics, etc.), fascinated by the possibilities of all the instruments, solutions and methodologies that could be molded and accommodated within such frameworks of articulating and thinking about things (e.g., as possible foundations for evolving complex adaptive systems, in distributed economies geared towards fueling specific applications and serving particular purposes, in the building of integrated knowledge discovery and SaaS platforms, open access public services, emerging markets servicing arising new needs, etc.)

At the same time trying to be aware of the less predictable consequences of the technology and its specific implementations (as with any new technology or technology-driven phase transition, usually accompanied by large-scale social cataclysms and shifting of power balances) in how they might influence the social fabric and re-organize everyday relations, the potential socio-economic and structural-demographic combined longer term impact and the institutional roles of the technology as it gradually integrates and further evolves alongside other loosely coupled actor-networks. Also, the adequately equipped means for orientation and sense-making within such increasingly complex environments where different motivations and agencies overlap, collude and intertwine.

Specifically of interest to me in that regard are the undertakings of IOTA and Ceptr (better known as Holochain, which itself constitutes the basis for incrementally building upon and integrating the other sub-system components of Ceptr and its comprehensive vision) as efforts that lay the supporting groundwork for fast approaching future horizons that need be accordingly channeled within structural frameworks capable of effectively utilizing their potential, while minimizing exploitable vulnerabilities and attack surfaces (e.g., the data-driven machine economy in the emerging landscape of interconnected IoT systems and their *ad hoc* meshnet swarms of sensor-equipped devices, or: organizational sense-making at different scales, forms of decentralized autonomous organization and specialized record-keeping bureaucracies, etc.) - thereby giving some glimpse of an insight of what is necessary for maintaining a sense of grounded orientation in the present as extending into the future.

A fair example of *"sense-making"* that I take as such is an area of academic research known as cliodynamics (the term having been coined in the early 2000's). Cliodynamics outlines a multi-disciplinary approach to history which builds upon extensive historical databases in the *longue durée* that capture key driving variables throughout the history of societies and civilizations, using them to compare and approximate interdependencies, map out and correlate groups of variables (which reveal themselves interdependent in some way or another or together co-evolving and following from one another) and test the assumptions of hypotheses/mathematical models within the approximate ranges of what is known to the extent of lending itself to statistical analyses mapping back to the facts as they unfold along particular trajectories.

An approach I think generalizable as to eventually develop and extend into many other domains when considered in the context of a Semantic Web 3.0 and in a future where *"data is the new crude."* Trying to think along what ways could these technologies be applied in and adopted to help make better informed choices and influence sustainable policy-making with broader consideration of systemic consequences and non-linear side effects.

**Influenced and drawing much upon:** 

- *Gilles Deleuze* and his conceptual vocabulary (e.g., the rhizome as an *image of thought*, describing theory and research that allows for *"multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation."*)
- *Marshall McLuhan*. Media theory and studies, *"the medium is the message"* or how the medium of technology embeds itself and influences the perception of what it conveys, etc.
- *Bruno Latour*. Actor-Network Theory as a material-semiotic approach to social theory and science, which maps how shifting networks of relationships translate back and forth in bringing other agencies into being, revealing in the process often unexplored assumptions underlying some commonly accepted terms and notions.

> *"The challenge is to support diverse, autocatalytic networks of human agents that can propel transformations toward goals such as sustainable energy, fueling the efficient cycling of resources. This is particularly challenging given a social and economic paradigm of short-term localized gain and relatively weak global, unifying, long-term structures to counteract this paradigm."*
>
> - Bruno Latour

**More specific recent areas of interest:** 

- Functional and dataflow programming 
- Actor-Network Theory (ANT) 
- Bayesian methods/probability statistics 
- Open communication protocols and networks 
- Ways of constructing reliable economic signals (prediction market event derivatives, currency design, etc.)
- Tools and methods for investigation, forensics and audit trail reconstruction of network events in public records (in social networks, blockchain-based public ledgers, web scraping of public registries, etc.) 
- Decentralized governance models (setting up specific attractors and autonomous feedback mechanisms) and systems of knowledge representation (i.e., domain-specific ontologies)
