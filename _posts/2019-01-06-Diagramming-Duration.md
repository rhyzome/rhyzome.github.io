> __Finding words for multiplicity__

>Bergson repeatedly confronted the difficulty that the very means to describe or elucidate his metaphysics seem to run contrary to or betray its essential tenets. In retrospect, one may see the wide disciplinary sweep of Bergson’s writings as in part a reaction to this problem; it is as if he pursued an ongoing search for the linguistic and conceptual ground most appropriate for expressing his philosophical system. Today, thinking through Bergson’s work in the light of contemporary medialities, we may add an additional, retrospective line of speculation. This essay argues that scientific techniques enabled by digital media provide a means of resolving specific difficulties Bergson encountered in trying to translate temporal concepts into language.

>Bergson’s particular dilemma, we might use his own terms and say that the very act of representing multiplicity in words presents a potential trap, that to do so is to transpose a virtual concept into an actualized symbolic entity.

>The short essay “Introduction à la métaphysique,” originally published in 1903, provides a particularly cogent instance of Bergson trying to find the right words to convey his idea that duration is a certain form of multiplicity. This text succinctly summarizes the philosophy developed in *Durée et simultanéité* and *Matière et mémoire*. And because it purported to provide a compressed, accessible introduction to his thought and method, this work reveals the crux of Bergson’s struggle with language: on the one hand, he demonstrates his power as a philosophical writer, which rests largely in his ability to convey metaphysical concepts by creating easily comprehensible metaphors or analogies; on the other hand though, each explanatory figure he uses fails in some way, forcing him ultimately to locate the true nature of duration just beyond the reach of language. It is in the very gaps where these shortcomings reside that our retrospective reading of Bergson and medialities begins its work.

>__Metaphysics must struggle to adhere to an asignifying stream of thought, which does not differentiate its proper object (duration as continuous multiplicity) by projecting it onto discrete symbols. Thus while science re-presents its objects of study in mathematical terms and spatial models, Bergson argues, metaphysics will be founded on an immediate apprehension of its objects of thought from within. It will generate intuitive knowledge based on a “sympathy” with its object rather than “analysis” of the whole in terms of its parts.__

>>*"Certainly concepts are indispensable [to metaphysics], because all the other sciences work most commonly on concepts, and metaphysics can not do without other sciences, but it is itself only when it exceeds the concept, or at least when it frees itself from straightforward and ready-made concepts to create concepts very different from those we usually handle, I mean flexible, mobile, almost fluid representations, always ready to be molded on the fleeting forms of intuition."*
