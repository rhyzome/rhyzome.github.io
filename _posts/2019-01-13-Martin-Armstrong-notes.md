# On Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies

#### [Have Cryptocurrencies Become a Religion?](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/have-cryptocurrencies-become-a-religion/):

>If we are talking about simple Bitcoin as a **trading vehicle**, then fine. We added it to the Global Market Watch and Socrates because it is a tradable asset. It is really just like everything else that trades. Socrates called the high in Bitcoin simply because it complied with the trading patterns like everything else that is really not the asset, but how humans interact with that asset (Behavioural Economics). Its value is based upon **ANTICIPATION** and that need not be real, possible, and it may be outright impossible. If you believe in something you react according to your beliefs even if it is completely irrational.
>
>[...]
>
>Cryptocurrencies are trading vehicles. **Cryptocurrencies will NEVER replace the dollar or world currencies**. Do you really think governments will simply allow such a venture to take all their power away without a fight? **Cryptocurrencies are worthless without a power grid**. That is a disadvantage even to mackerel. That said, it does not stop Bitcoin from being a trading asset, but it is not money. It trades on a belief system of some that are completely irrational of which you will NEVER convince the majority to agree with them any more than they could with gold.
>
>[...]
>
>**The monetary system will come to an end as we know it today. It will be replaced with an electronic reserve currency among nations. That will NOT be something that you use to go shopping with. I do not care what you call money. It is nothing more than a unit of account and a medium of exchange. It historically sits on the opposite side of assets. Bitcoin is still an asset – it is NOT money. If Bitcoin were money, then it would decline in purchasing power when assets rise.**


#### [As long as Cryptocurrencies remain Assets – Then they will Survive a Monetary Crisis](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/as-long-as-cryptocurrencies-remain-assets-then-they-will-survive-a-monetary-crisis/):

>The year 2018 was the start of the Monetary Crisis. We had a shot that this could all come undone in 2018. However, you are correct. All we achieved was a false rally with the Euro stopping just shy of our number and gold struggled admirably but could not get through 1362. 
>
>There were many other markets also confirming that we are dealing with only the beginning of the crisis here in 2018 rather than the conclusion including the consolidation in the stock market without election any monthly bearish reversals. The monetary reset can arrive during the next window in time come 2021 if we get the dollar at new highs. Then the monetary system will crack. However, this could drag out to the third window which is of course 2032. That appears to be more the shift of the Financial Capital of the World to China at that time.
>
>These are the turning points. The Reversals are the key which confirms or denies the trend. My opinion as to the future is still an opinion. I will say this. **As long as cryptocurrencies are an asset class, then they will survive a monetary crisis along with all other assets. Assets are the ONLY thing that survives the collapse of a currency.**
>
>**Tangible assets are on the opposite side of whatever the currency is in use. When the stock market rises, the purchasing power of the currency declines. When the stock market crashes, then the purchasing power of the currency rises. They are on OPPOSITE sides. Do you really want a cryptocurrency to be a currency or asset? Most people pitching them are really explaining an alternative asset – not a currency.**


#### [Are Cryptocurrencies a Fictional Dream?](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/are-cryptocurrencies-a-fictional-dream/):

>There are a lot of problems with the technology and it would clearly make the entire economy vulnerable to a crisis in the failure of platforms or the power grid. **Goldman Sachs sees the opportunity because of all the fraud. They are looking at stepping in as a CUSTODIAN because the integrity of the security behind a cryptocurrency is often questionable.**
>
>**In war, you target the electricity grid as a first objective and then the total economy would collapse as well as the effort to fund a war. During a war, governments have often counterfeited each other’s currency. The British did that with American colonial currency. If they could undermine the confidence and cause hyperinflation, then funding the war effort would collapse. Today, you would do this by hacking and targeting the power grid.**
>
>In all the high-level meetings I have had about this technological innovation, the single greatest concern is would it make a nation more vulnerable during a war? Can a cyber attack simply paralyze the economy? Keep in mind that only about 4% of the economy takes place in cash. The rest is electronic deposits. Therefore, this threat is NOT limited to cryptocurrencies. It may very well be the next way to win a war. Attack the banking system and you will freeze the ability to fund a war. Don’t think they are not thinking about that right now.


#### [Cryptocurrency Scam?](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-scam/):

>Socrates picked the high in Bitcoin perfectly. How? Why? Very simple in fact. **No matter what instrument you look at, the chart is not actually that instrument. It is a chart of HUMAN emotion relating TO THAT instrument.** The chart of silver from 1980 is similar to that of Bitcoin. Back then, they were touting silver would go to $100. They swore it would do that any day for the next 19 years. We have people in Bitcoin swearing it is going to $100,000 and become the new reserve currency. That is such a joke for any currency to be worth that much would guarantee it cannot be used in commerce since most transactions are small. **Then to be the reserve currency means governments would have to issue debt in Bitcoin. Come on! Are these claims even practical?**


#### [Can Cryptocurrencies Survive?](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/can-cryptocurrencies-survive/):

>**Bitcoin became the LEADING means of money laundering and movement of cash out of China, circumventing their rule of law and currency controls. So do not think for one minute that Bitcoin rose because it was really a wonderful idea?**
>
>The government has the army, tanks, and the guns and soon robot soldiers. Until the army is willing to turn against the hand that feeds them, which is why they are developing robot soldiers, you cannot stand with cryptocurrency and claim some magical right to suppress government and central banks. You need the power grid!
>
>**I have been skeptical about the claims that cryptocurrencies will replace all money and central banks and end banking creating money out of thin air. That would be recreating the Dark Age. For that to take place there can be no lending. The mortgage market would collapse and the value of the property would fall to less than 10% of its worth becomes the maximum someone has cash as was the case during the Great Depression. This hatred of central banks is stupid. The money they create is less than 10% of the money supply. The bulk is created through lending and fractional banking.**

["Bitcoin – The End of Cryptocurrencies?"](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-the-end-of-cryptocurrencies/):

> There was no possible way governments would EVER hand over such power to Bitcoin. These people have no clue about the age of knowledge, for they are trapped in the age of stupidity. A monthly closing below 2950 will confirm the long-term trend is turning down. A year-end closing below 4150 will point to a drop back to 775 area. It was a trading vehicle – not an investment class for the long-term. **With the IMF telling all central banks to create their own cryptocurrency and the introduction of Blockchain in experimenting with tax collection, we face a very different future due to technology. However, it will not be a world of free-market cryptos that bring governments to their knees.**


["Central Banks Looking at Creating Their Own Cryptocurrencies"](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/cryptocurrency/central-banks-looking-at-creating-their-own-cryptocurrencies/):

> With adopting cryptocurrencies that governments would control, we will come one step closer to losing all our freedom. Central banks could enforce negative interest rates with cryptocurrencies and thus people would find their accounts just garnished. You could not hoard cash and withdraw it from banks. They are also looking at this as a way to manage a banking crisis stopping runs on banks. **This technology is also causing those in the hunting of tax revenues to lick their lips.**
>
> The issuance of digital currencies would allow central banks to remain in control of the money supply far more so than they are today. Sweden is moving forward and there we see that the use of cash is rapidly disappearing.
>
> **Cryptocurrency technology would allow also the taxman to just cometh and take whatever he desires in the midst of the economic crisis we face. The Central Banks would be able to maintain greater control over the creation of money through the process of leverage (bank lending).**


["Australia Inserting Nano-Chips in $50 & $100 Bills to Track Underground Economy & Coming Barter System"](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/armstrongeconomics101/economics/australia-inserting-nano-chips-in-50-100-bills-to-track-underground-economy-coming-barter-system/):

> While the Bitcoin people have hated me for not agreeing with them that a private currency could displace the currencies of all nations and Bitcoin would be the new **“reserve currency”** killing the dollar, to me they are in serious need of help. They have **ZERO** comprehension of governmental power and **ZERO** understanding of what is going on behind the curtain. The IMF has come out and stated that each nation should issue their own cryptocurrency and these fools cheers claiming I am not with it and do not get this new age of technology. Sorry, but these people are really clueless if not perhaps undercover people with a mission to get people willing to surrender their final liberty – paper money.
>
> While cryptobugs advocate gold is dead and Bitcoin will conquer the financial world, they miss the point entirely. The IMF is by no means embracing cryptocurrencies for the same reason these people have claimed it will bypass central banks. The IMF is advocating the end of paper money to kill the underground or black economy solely to aid the hunt for taxes and to **PREVENT** bank runs. If there is no paper money, how can you run to the bank in a panic demanding to withdraw your money? They also argue eliminating paper money will end crime.

## [**Comprehending The Capabilities of AI**](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/products_services/socrates/comprehending-the-capabilities-of-ai/):    

> __QUESTION__: Mr. Armstrong – Neural nets and deep-learning algos are not all that new. However, with the advent of quantum computing power and huge cloud data stores recording every flinch people make, the business world is abuzz that this is the portent for AI to now transform business, business management, and our lives. Of course, trading systems are now being ‘trained’ on datasets. However, regardless the algo, it’s learning capacity is still limited by the extent of the data that it is presented. Since you have spent so much exhaustive work amassing such a long-term financial (and governmental, etc.) database, using even such things as coinage records for your forensics, I have to wonder if these other systems will still have a long run to go before their forecasting power can match that of your models. Do you expect this to provide Socrates an advantage over the new wave of AI market/trading forecasters that will last for some time yet?  
>
> __ANSWER__: The long-term database is essential. That cost more than $100 million to assemble and quite frankly, nobody seems to be willing to spend that much. This is why all prior models have collapsed creating economic catastrophes such as Long-Term Capital Management debacle. They collapsed again in 2007. Nevertheless, then you have the problem of Neutral Nets are just incapable of handling the vast array of variables. The attempts to create trading models are all flat-model based. Our system has made so many accurate forecasts for so long on so many markets around the globe that I do not even comment on. It is far too much for me to even write about. That is the whole purpose of Socrates.  
>
> I had to design a completely different programming technique to work out the complexity. Just image calculating every market in the world in 35 different currencies. The number of variables is beyond comprehension. If we are talking about a limited number of variables for normal business operations, Neural Nets are fine. When it comes to market forecasting, they can develop a Deep Learning system on a single market, but without correlating this with all other markets, you will NEVER see the contagion coming. When everything crashed in 1998 because of the collapse in the Russian debt markets, the illiquidity caused funds to sell other assets to raise cash to cover losses elsewhere. The Russian bond collapse caused a massive sell-off in Japanese yen/dollar rate that had absolutely NOTHING to do with the fundamentals in Japan. Contagions always emerge externally so you can create a model and it will work for a while and then you lose everything.

Selected parts of "Methods and Methodologies" (2nd Edition):

> # Introduction  
>
> Princeton Economics employs a completely different school of innovative thinking based on a non-subjective interpretation of market and economic movement, which is essential in understanding the development of the world economy and financial markets.  
>
> At Princeton Economics, we have created the first AI database (Socrates) capable of tracking capital flows on an international basis. To compile our database, we spent decades tracking the monetary history of the world, beginning with the earliest known forms of currency. We then created a system capable of building knowledge upon the accomplishments and failures of the past. Socrates considers all potential economic and social variables by gathering data on everything from stocks, bonds, interest rates, and commodities to political trends, wars, and civil unrest. Socrates monitors nearly every currency in circulation to grasp a truly global perspective of the global economy. Most importantly, Socrates generates analyses without human intervention. This ensures that our analyses are non-subjective by removing the bias of personal observation.  
>
> # Understanding Technical Analysis  
>
> When used in isolation [technical analysis] to determine market patterns, technical analysis is subjective and produces different results depending on whom is doing the analysis. Perhaps the greatest threat to forecasting lies in the Observer Effect, which states that the observer subconsciously inserts his or her own biases into the analysis, thus altering the results. For this reason, Princeton Economics does not employ Fibonacci Timing, Elliot Wave, Kondratieff Wave, or other similar models. Although price can be determined using forms of technical analysis, measuring only the shape of a wave dismisses the importance of time.  
>
> Princeton Economics also employs the use of cyclical analysis, which by definition is the analysis of a time series that isolates regular rhythmic patterns of oscillation.  
>
> The three primary dimensions of market and economic movement are (1) time, (2) price, and (3) volatility. However, a fourth dimension exists: interrelationships. Fundamental analysis aims to reduce things to a specific cause and effect, but that is not reality. Interrelationships and interconnectivity on a global scale are what really matters. For example, a company’s earnings may be seen as bullish domestically, yet bearish internationally. Within this realm, the fundamental approach must be global in nature and never isolated to purely domestic trends.  
>
> At Princeton Economics, we use a method called International Capital Flow Analysis that conforms to quantitative standards by monitoring the interactions across major world economies which enables us to obtain consistent long-term forecasts.  
>
> # Understanding the Importance of World Capital Flows  
>
> Science has come to understand that man cannot create a rainforest by merely planting a group of trees and plants. There are millions of species of bacteria, insects, animals, plants, etc. that interact to form a balance within nature. Man cannot duplicate such a complex system due to his lack of knowledge concerning such a wealth of intricate variables interacting with one another to produce the final balanced system.  
>
> Another problem for man in grasping a full understanding of market and economic behavior lies in his conscious thought process. In our natural state, our mind processes and records data in a nonlinear fashion. For example, when we meet someone special, perhaps in a restaurant, our subconscious mind records the music and setting of the moment. The subconscious mind quietly observes what the other person is wearing, the color of the tablecloth, the flicker of the candlelight, the background music, etc. The conscious mind observes the conversation at hand. Months or even years later, if we hear or see one of those stimuli, our mind suddenly retrieves the experience and consciously relives the event, right down to the twinkle of the candlelight. Economic and market behavior is quite similar to the operation of our mind. There are numerous hidden variables within the equation that produces the end result. Consciously, we focus on only a small fraction of those variables involved and then desperately try to reduce every event to a single cause.  
>
> For example, we may pay attention to something like unemployment and its influence on interest rates. We then try to interpret and pass judgement as to what the trend will be, based upon a handful of fundamental relationships. Inevitably, such analysis proves incorrect due to the lack of attention paid to the wealth of other variables. In financial analysis, we ignore the actual process of collecting knowledge by continually trying to reduce the entire fate or the world into a few simplistic relationships.   
>
> As famed economist Adam Smith mentioned in his Wealth of Nations, we all act according to our own self-interests. Today this is magnified due to currencies becoming far more visible on a global scale. Percentage swings of even 40% in two years have become much more commonplace. Only a global model that filters in all key economic data along with free market movements that includes everything from bonds and stocks to wheat and aluminum, can hope to ascertain the trend.   
>
> The test of a real bull or bear market is one rising or falling on a global scale that is not limited purely to one’s domestic currency perspective. What can appear to be bullish in local currency can look dramatically different in international currency. Currency has become everything and it is crucial to understand capital flows. Global trends are the result of smaller trends emerging from every economy around the world. The trends in international capital are set in motion by the forces of taxation, inflation, financial security, foreign exchange, labor costs, geopolitics, and of course meddling politicians. There are some minor influences as well, such as interest rate differentials. Nevertheless, capital is continually flowing from one economy to the next in search of profit and/or financial stability. This is nothing new as capital has been global for a very long time. There was even the Silk Road between the West and East that dates back to the Stone Age.  
>
>
> # The Shape of a Wave  
>
> One of the great misconceptions in cycle theory is the notion that cycles unfold in a purely symmetrical wave formation that is transverse in structure. This is simply not true, as we will explore. There are also longitudinal wave structures where there is no symmetrical distance between peaks. Both the Kondratieff Wave and Samuel Benner’s Wave structure are longitudinal in nature. Perhaps instinctively, Benner understood cyclical shapes and thus saw the repetitive patterns. Kondratieff merely identified three cyclical waves of varying duration (wavelengths) and failed to address repetitive patterns.  
>
> Another fallacy that has prevented many from understanding cyclical movements has been the concept of efficient markets adhering to some mysterious equilibrium that forms a magical balancing act, such as the idea of supply and demand, existing inherently within the system. The idea of equilibrium is like drawing a center line in the path of the swinging pendulum. It is not the center line that provides the attraction and driving force of the pendulum, rather it is always the two extreme forces on either side. There is no state of perfect equilibrium acting as some mysterious driving force, nor is there an efficient center force that the economy aims to achieve.    
>
> The __Economic Confidence Model__, developed by Princeton Economic Intl. Chairman and renowned economist Martin Armstrong, __is a wave structure that builds in intensity through six individual waves of 8.6 years that form a major wave of 51.6 years, which in turn builds up once again into a 309.6-year structure. There is a fractal nature to this wave structure. Additionally, it incorporates events that appear to come from nowhere, such as a rogue wave of combined force in the ocean. It is by no means a one-dimensional bell curve. The shape of the wave structure is vital to understand.__    
>
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/t2yaMYF.jpg)  
>
> Two different forms of cyclical patterns are important to understand and are general in description rather than a precise formula. Cycle pattern #1 is generally short, sweet, and to the point. This first pattern is what we call a self-ordered motion within the system whereby the resolution of an overbought state extinguishes rapidly. This tends to be the general pattern of the free market when left to its own devices.  
>
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/gfugGE6.jpg)  
>
> Cycle pattern #2 generally emerges from some form of government intervention. By preventing the decline between points 4 and 5, government tends to prevent resolution that leaves market participants holding, waiting for the day when they will be made whole. Real estate also tends to follow pattern #2 as it is based upon mortgages, which once burnt, causes banks to shy away from real estate due to the fact that it is not a liquid market once the cycle turns down.  
>
>
> # Phase Transition  
>
> In physics, a physical system exists called a Phase Transition that crosses the boundary between two changes in its properties in a fundamental way. For example, we can create a Phase Transition by boiling water and moving from water to a gas. In simpler terms, a Phase Transition changes in state from one form to another. Whatever exists in physical systems also exists within the realm of economics for we may be biological organisms, but there is no exception to the laws of physics. In the markets, the Phase Transition explains abrupt movements in price. We can track the bullish and bearish consensus and see how it moves between the two extremes. A Phase Transition accounts for the change between the two extremes. However, this is by no means a linear progression. It very much follows the same general course as boiling water.  
>
> A Phase Transition accomplishes the same end game in physics as it does in economics. For example, we can move back and forth from a bearish state to a neutral state where bulls and bears tug back and forth to either state. The two extremes mark the dramatic conviction that swings of the opposite force covers them, causing the Phase Transition to unfold. This is not a normal bearish or bullish state, rather it is a compressed state of time that convinces the majority within the marketplace to switch sides.  
>
> Understanding the Phase Transition is critical to understanding how to trade. The greatest amount of gain and loss is accomplished in the shortest amount of time.  
>
>
> # Understanding Time  
>
> If there is no understanding of time, then you must take a loss for all you can do is buy and hold. If you do not have a concept of time, you will lose everything after a Phase Transition. You need to know when changes in trend will appear and begin to shift direction in advance of the event unfolding. You cannot turn a battle ship on a dime, and therefore time is essential when it comes to managing large portfolios.  
>
> Many assume that forecasts concerning time may possibly be accurate in the short-term, but they remain skeptical about long-term timing forecasts. Many argue that major political events cannot possibly be predicted in advance. To the contrary, such events would not take place unless the economic condition had been in a steep decline. Computers cannot predict what type of revolution will unfold as a result of a collapsing economy, but they can predict when some sort of political change will take place due to economic pressures. Since the dawn of civilization, no revolution has ever taken place unless man was first economically deprived. Time is something that is quantifiable as everything has a cycle.  
>
> Contrary to popular belief, quantitative long-term timing forecasts actually display a higher level of accuracy than the short-term. Long-term trends are set in motion by a combination of forces, and these forces cannot turn around on a dime. Short-term trends involve a lot of noise. People can become excited and falsely believe that the trend is changing, rushing in where only fools would go. The trend fails and suddenly they bail out, causing the market to revert back to the longer-term trend. The short-term is highly volatile; the long-term trend is actually easier to predict than the short-term noise.  
>
> The critical aspect about time is that it is truly fractal in its construction. There are numerous timing frequencies in a single market created by the many minor trends from a variety of different investment strategies. We have found that long-term frequencies always overpower short-term frequencies. Therefore, an 8-week cycle producing a low will be overpowered by a 20-week cycle due to produce a high at the same time. One could say that the 8-week cycle inverted or cancelled out by the stronger 20-week cycle. As this process of long-term cycles dominating the short-term occurs, one begins to realize that long-term cycles are more reliable than the short-term because they are far more difficult to change.  
>
> The cyclical process is how all forms of energy move. It is how light moves, sound, and even electricity. The attraction of two opposite forces creates a self-propelling mechanism that operates according to economic entropy, which is the measure of driving forces (energy) as it is expended and is no longer available to continue to drive the cycle in that direction. Once the bullish energy is expended, then the attractive force in the opposite direction (bearish) overpowers the remaining bullish force and compels the cycle to then change direction to the bearish attractor. This self-perpetuating endless cycle of life drives the entire mechanism.  
>
> # Timing Models  
>
> There are three primary methodologies to cyclical analysis, each with numerous layers of inherent complexity.  
>
> 1) Composite Timing Models (Longitudinal Cyclical Waves)  
> 2) Empirical Timing Models (Transverse Cyclical Waves)  
> 3) Trading Timing Models (Differential Cyclical Waves)  
>
> __i. Composite Timing Models__  
>
> Composite Timing Models are longitudinal cyclical waves that expand and contract with no definitive fixed duration between each wave. Composite Timing Models tend to repeat in a broader overall group pattern. 
>
> For example, one wave may be 13 days, the next 34 days, followed by another 17-day cycle, and finishing with an 8-day cycle. This may generate a pattern of 72 days, which then repeats.  
>
> This type of cyclical activity is addressed through Composite Timing Models, as they are the result of a harmonic mix of many other timing elements. Composite frequencies form from cyclical frequencies within the same market and external influences from other markets across the globe.  
>
> __ii. Empirical Timing Models__  
>
> Transverse wave structures with fixed length timing frequencies also exist within a market that is symmetrical in shape. We call this our Empirical Timing Model, meaning they are “fixed” in wavelength.  
>
> For example, gold has historically had an 8-week cycle. At times, because of the Superposition Principle, this cycle will undergo Destructive Inference and fail to produce a Turning Point. This can cause the cycle to appear longitudinal in construction, yet it remains very much transverse.  
>
> A fixed length cycle of 8 weeks may produce a high and low precisely every 8 weeks or for a
> brief period in time. This cycle may suddenly disappear if it becomes overpowered by a longer timing frequency from monthly, quarterly, or even yearly levels of activity within the same market or influenced by interconnectivity of other market trends. After a few apparent failures, this 8-week cycle will suddenly reappear exactly on target as if nothing had happened. This fixed length cycle never changes in duration. When it stops working, it is only because a frequency of greater importance is taking control. The greater force may be from within the same market or the result of global interrelationships.  
>
> Empirical Models are very important timing elements. Just because a particular timing frequency may appear successful on a few occasions does not guarantee its validity. Each timing frequency employed in our Empirical Models has been historically tested as far back as possible under all possible conditions. A frequency is only valid if it is consistent during a bull and bear market. The majority of mistakes made by analysts are caused by the use of timing models that have not been tested in both bull and bear markets.  
>
> __iii. Trading Timing Models__  
>
> Our Trading Timing Models are concerned solely with the nominal differences between bull and bear market frequencies and traits. Our turning points generated by this model reflect the statistical differences between these opposing trends without consideration of various timing frequencies or intermarket relationships. The model specifically states what the expected events should be (high or low) at a particular time interval. Unlike the other two previously mentioned models, Trading Timing Models offer a union of time and direction, and thus enable the user to qualify the forecast. Consequently, our Trading Timing Models can offer a completely independent view as to what to expect.  
>
> Since trends become clearer during violent price action, this tool performs best during panics in either direction. The periods when this pool provides a lower degree of accuracy is during quiet non-trading periods. These are periods when both forces are about equal and tend to cancel each other out.  
>
> This model recognizes that each market and sector has its own unique frequency. For example, agricultural stocks are greatly influences by weather, crops, plating cycles, etc. and thus are highly prone to greater volatility than one would find in other commodities, bonds, or stocks.  
>
> # Bifurcation Models and the Science of Chaos  
>
> Bifurcation is the mathematical study of changes in the quantitative or topological structure of a given family. This includes the study of changes in the qualitative structure of a dynamic system that is nonlinear based and includes integral curves of a group of vector fields, and the solutions of a group of different equations.  
>
> This enables the computer to observe a bifurcation, which occurs when a small subtle change takes place in one of the inputs that form the parameter values (bifurcation parameters) within a system that then causes a sudden “qualitative” or topological change in its behavior.  
>
> __Bifurcation analysis is the process of attempting to find a specific point in time and price that acts as a "strange attractor" in market or economic movement.__  
>
> # Conclusion  
>
> Everything is connected. Although most traders accept time, price, and volatility as important components of analysis, a fourth component of greater importance — interrelationships — is often overlooked. The global economy is much like a rainforest with billions of lifeforms all depending on one another. To analyze and model this kind of complex environmental and societal economic system requires research that views the system as a whole, as well as its component parts, to reveal the interconnected data that lies hidden beneath the surface. This allows for the combination of small influences to cascade into larger global trends, just as removing one species in a rainforest will set off a chain reaction with unintended or unknowable results. We are incapable of constructing a rainforest because we do not understand all the subtle interconnections.  
>
> We live in a Complex Adaptive Dynamic System; it is not possible to reduce such a complex system to a single cause and effect, as fundamental analysis aims to do. We recognize that history repeats, but never in the same manner, which is why we employ the use of cyclical analysis to analyze regular rhythmic patterns of oscillation. Technical analysis, when used in isolation to predict market patterns, is subjective and produces different results depending on whom is performing the analysis. To eliminate the Observer Effect, we developed an innovative computer system capable of forecasting the economy on a global scale without the need for human involvement.
