Located at [Perperikon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perperikon), this is thought to have been a sacrificial altar of the [Thracians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians). Ancient authors have described the Thracians to have practiced blood sacrifices, usually of large animals, but also on occasion of humans.
